## Long-term style seeding (Micro / Gross / Path)

You can seed the rewrite style with your own phrase library stored in the repo.

1. Copy `data/style_seed.example.json` to `data/style_seed.json`.
2. Put your snippets under keys: `micro`, `gross`, and/or `path`.
3. Restart the server, or call:
   - `POST /api/rewrite/reload-style-seed`

Notes:
- This is best for curated style snippets from your own docs (including content copied from Word).
- Confirmed examples saved with **Save Corrected** still persist to `data/rewrite_learning.json`.
- Both the curated seed file and saved corrections are used together to steer future output style.
