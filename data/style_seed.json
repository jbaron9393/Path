    "This placenta demonstrates small size, prominent accelerated maturation of villi, bleeding and clot at the basal plate with focal evidence of chronicity (hemosiderin-laden macrophages), and multiple parenchymal infarcts, in the setting of muscularization and fibrinoid necrosis of maternal vessels. During normal placental development, implantation site trophoblast should convert muscular arterioles in the basal plate to low-resistance vessels. Persistence of the muscular wall indicates inadequate conversion and may be associated with pre-eclampsia or maternal hypertension, as suggested by this patient’s clinical history. Altogether, these placental findings suggest an underlying problem with maternal perfusion of the placenta, called maternal vascular malperfusion. Common causes include maternal vascular disease, diabetes, chronic hypertension/preeclampsia, thrombophilia, and maternal drug use. While downstream effects for the fetus are variable, worse outcomes are typically associated with larger parenchymal lesions. In this case, the thrombi and infarct encompass a relatively small proportion of parenchyma.",
    "This placenta demonstrates mild findings of fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM), with a minority of parenchymal villi affected by this process (including avascular villi and villi with stromal-vascular karyorrhexis).  Upstream obstruction to fetal blood flow is present, as evidenced by intramural fibrin deposition within large-caliber fetal vessels.  The delayed villous maturation is also often associated with this diagnosis.  The foci of damaged villi are distributed across several parenchymal slides, but involve small clusters of villi (global/partial pattern, low-grade). These changes suggest intermittent restriction in fetal blood flow to the placenta, often caused by umbilical cord pathology. Fetal vascular malperfusion is commonly associated with obstructive umbilical cord lesions or thrombi within large fetal vessels, often due to an \"umbilical cord at risk\" (long umbilical cord, hypercoiled cord, stricture, velamentous insertion, prolapse or cord entanglements such as nuchal cord).  None of these risk factors were reportedly present at delivery or upon gross examination of this placenta. Fetal coagulopathy or cardiac failure can also present as fetal vascular malperfusion, although the pattern of injury is often different from findings in this case (i.e. segmental pattern FVM). In this case, clinical correlation is required to determine the most likely etiology. The low grade designation of this lesion typically correlates in isolation with benign fetal outcomes; again clinical correlation and followup are recommended.",
    "This placenta demonstrates findings of high-grade fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM), overall affecting less than 5% of parenchyma. The pattern of injury is most consistent with a segmental/complete distribution, including intermediate-caliber stem villi with occlusive vascular calcifications, and 2 large foci (greater than 45 villi affected per focus) of clustered villi with stromal vascular karyorrhexis. Scattered avascular villi are also present in these areas. The delayed villous maturation is also common in FVM. Fetal vascular malperfusion is commonly associated with obstructive umbilical cord lesions or thrombi within large fetal vessels, often due to an \"umbilical cord at risk\" (long umbilical cord, hypercoiled cord, stricture, velamentous insertion, prolapse or cord entanglements). None of these risk factors were reportedly present at delivery or upon gross examination of this placenta. Of note, the segmental pattern (more than the global/partial pattern) may be associated with fetal coagulopathy including protein C or S deficiencies, factor V Leiden, or MTHFR mutations, or with maternal antiphospholipid or antiplatelet antibodies which cross into fetal circulation. In this case, clinical correlation is required to determine the most likely etiology. The high grade designation of this lesion has been shown to correlate with adverse clinical fetal outcomes, including cerebral palsy and neonatal encephalopathy. However, this placenta demonstrates a relatively low percentage of involved sampled parenchyma. Again clinical correlation and followup are recommended."

Per report, NeoGenomics identified PHF6 C20Lfs*2 and TP53 R282W mutations; FISH demonstrated a gain of chromosome 5; and karyotyping showed a normal female karyotype. These findings may be seen in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS). Of note, the submitted marrow material does not show definitive morphologic evidence of dysplasia, and review of the prior bone marrow biopsy report from September 2025 (25UB:IB-1367) similarly does not describe overt dysplastic changes. Nonetheless, an underlying myelodysplastic process cannot be entirely excluded, particularly in the context of the patient's clinical and molecular findings.

It may also occur in subsequent pregnancies.",
